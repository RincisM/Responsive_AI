## Abstract

Explainable AI (XAI) aims to demystify the decision-making process of
complex models, providing users and stakeholders with insights into the
factors influencing predictions.This project explores and implements
three widely-used explainability techniques - SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)
,ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5), and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
Explanations) - to enhance the interpretability of AI models

The project involves integrating these three techniques into a cohesive
framework for XAI. A diverse set of AI models, spanning from classical
machine learning algorithms to deep neural networks, will be employed
to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed approach. The project
aims to showcase the strengths and limitations of each technique in
different contexts, providing a comparative analysis of their
effectiveness.
Additionally, the user interface will be developed to facilitate the
interaction with the XAI framework, allowing users to input data, view
explanations, and gain insights into the model's decision-making
