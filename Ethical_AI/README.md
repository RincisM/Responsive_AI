****Abstract:****

The YouTube Video Classification App aims to provide users with a comprehensive analysis of the sentiment and explicit content within YouTube videos. The primary goal is to offer insights into the emotional tone of videos, categorizing sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally, the app evaluates the presence of explicit content through a sophisticated analysis, helping users assess the appropriateness of the video's content. With a user-friendly interface, the app enables users to input a YouTube video URL, select subtitles language preferences, and receive detailed visualizations, including pie charts for sentiment distribution, bar charts for sentiment word counts, and word clouds for a graphical representation of frequently used words. The integration of external libraries such as NLTK, Matplotlib, WordCloud, and Profanity Check, along with YouTube API, enhances the app's capabilities in natural language processing and content analysis. This mini-project serves as a valuable tool for content creators, educators, and anyone interested in gaining deeper insights into the emotional and contextual aspects of YouTube video content.
